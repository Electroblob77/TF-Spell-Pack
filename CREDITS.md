Electroblob's Wizardry: Twilight Forest Spell Pack  
Version 1.1.0  
For Minecraft 1.12.2, Twilight Forest 3.10 and Wizardry 4.3

Designed, coded and textured by Electroblob

Massive thanks to Benimatic and the rest of Team Twilight (Drullkus, AtomicBlom, Tamaized, williewillus) for developing _The Twilight Forest_ and making it open-source so developers like me can build on all the awesome stuff you've made.

This work incorporates and adapts a few small bits of code and assets from _The Twilight Forest_; used in accordance with the GNU Lesser General Public License. Please notify me if there is any person or organisation who ought to be credited here and is not already, and they will be added.

Thanks to Minecraft Forge and MCP, without which Wizardry and this addon would not have been possible.

Thanks also to the Minecraft modding community, which always has an answer to my modding problems!
